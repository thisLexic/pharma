# Pharmacy Django Website ðŸ’Š

This is used for managing the payroll, time-in/time-out, and government benefits (SSS, PhilHealth, PAGIBIG) of our pharmacy employees. It can also generate daily sales, expense, and payroll reports of our pharmacies. This was created for the use of our family business.
